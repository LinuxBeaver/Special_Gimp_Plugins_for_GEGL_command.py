# Special_Gimp_Plugins_for_GEGL_command.py
Forks of certain GEGL Gimp Plugins of mine specially meant for GEGL_command.py (so they can be called in python) these filters do NOT show up in Gimp's GUI (unless a python dev uses them) In this repo is a pdf file that list all filters of mine that currently work with gegl_command.py

This repo is for python developers and corresponds to this thread on Gimp Chat. Its not for average users as it is clones of existing filters that work with python scripts.
